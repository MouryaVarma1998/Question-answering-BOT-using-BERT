I performed fine-tuning of a pre-trained Bi-directional Encoder Representation with Transformer (BERT) model using the PyTorch library. I used tokenization techniques to prepare the data and adeptly extracted features from the pre-trained BERT model, allowing us to capture contextual information. To optimize our BERT model for specific tasks, I implemented the Adam optimization algorithm, enhancing its performance and adaptability. This project represents a crucial step toward leveraging the cutting-edge capabilities of BERT for various natural language processing applications, including sentiment analysis, text classification, and more.
